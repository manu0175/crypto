Cryptocurrency Price Forecasting

# Inspiration

Cryptocurrencies are fast becoming rivals to traditional currency across the world. The digital currencies are available to purchase in many different places, making it accessible to everyone, and with retailers accepting various cryptocurrencies it could be a sign that money as we know it is about to go through a major change.

In addition, the blockchain technology on which many cryptocurrencies are based, with its revolutionary distributed digital backbone, has many other promising applications. Implementations of secure, decentralized systems can aid us in conquering organizational issues of trust and security that have plagued our society throughout the ages. In effect, we can fundamentally disrupt industries core to economies, businesses and social structures, eliminating inefficiency and human error.


# What It Does :

In this notebook I attempt to predict the price of cryptocurrencies for the next few months.
I will initially work with only the Bitcoin data and may in future generalise the code and use it for other cryptos if it works out for  Bitcoin.

# How We do it :

The program is divided into several sections. Each section performs a specific task in the analysis of cryptocurrencies. The following are the sections of the program:

Data Collection: In this section, the program collects data from various sources to use for analysis.
Data Cleaning: Here, the data collected is cleaned and pre-processed for use in the machine learning algorithms.
Exploratory Data Analysis: This section provides insights into the data collected and shows various plots and graphs that help in understanding the data better.
Feature Engineering: This section selects relevant features from the data and creates new features that could help improve the accuracy of the machine learning models.
Model Selection and Training: Here, various machine learning models are tested and trained using the data collected and pre-processed. The best model is then selected for further analysis.
Model Evaluation: In this section, the selected model is evaluated using various metrics to determine its accuracy and effectiveness.
Trading Strategy: Finally, a trading strategy is developed based on the results obtained from the machine learning model.

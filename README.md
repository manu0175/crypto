Cryptocurrency Price Forecasting

Cryptocurrencies are fast becoming rivals to traditional currency across the world. The digital currencies are available to purchase in many different places, making it accessible to everyone, and with retailers accepting various cryptocurrencies it could be a sign that money as we know it is about to go through a major change.

In addition, the blockchain technology on which many cryptocurrencies are based, with its revolutionary distributed digital backbone, has many other promising applications. Implementations of secure, decentralized systems can aid us in conquering organizational issues of trust and security that have plagued our society throughout the ages. In effect, we can fundamentally disrupt industries core to economies, businesses and social structures, eliminating inefficiency and human error.

In this notebook I attempt to predict the price of cryptocurrencies for the next few months.

I will initially work with only the Bitcoin data and may in future generalise the code and use it for other cryptos if it works out for  Bitcoin.
